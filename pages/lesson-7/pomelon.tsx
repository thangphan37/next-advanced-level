          Vietnam has moved closer to gaining access to the US for its pomelos
          after the US Department of Agricultureâ€™s Animal and Plant Health
          Inspection Service (APHIS) prepared its pest risk assessment. Gaining
          access has been a number of years in the making for the Vietnamese
          industry with the Covid-19 pandemic creating delays. The APHIS
          published its pest risk assessment on 27 December 2021 and is taking
          feedback until 25 February 2022. Following this, the agency will
          announce a final decision regarding the authorisation of fresh pomelo
          fruit from Vietnam.
